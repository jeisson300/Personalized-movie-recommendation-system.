# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course




## Background

The problem that my idea seeks to solve is the overload of movie options on streaming platforms, which makes it difficult for users to find movies they like. This problem is very common nowadays due to the vast amount of content available online. My personal motivation is to help people find movies they really enjoy and also improve the experience of using streaming platforms.


## How is it used?

The solution is used in the context of streaming platforms such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, and can be used by anyone who has difficulty finding movies to watch. The affected public are the users of these platforms.


## Data sources and AI methods
The recommendation system will depend on movie data, such as genre, actors, directors, user ratings, etc. Machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis can be used to build a predictive model that suggests similar movies to the ones the user likes.

## Challenges

The solution will not solve the problem of finding movies outside of streaming platforms. In addition, the quality of the recommendations will depend on the quality of the available data, so it will be necessary to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.

## What next?

The project could grow by including new features, such as the recommendation of television series or the integration with music platforms to suggest soundtracks.


## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the creators of open source libraries like Scikit-Learn and Pandas. I was also inspired by Netflix's movie recommendation system.
